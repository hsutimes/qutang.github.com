## Projects

* `Sep. 2017 - Present` Personalization of activity recognition algorithm

    > This is a series of ongoing projects that I am working on for my PhD dissertation. I try to explore solutions to several practical problems during algorithm personalization. Such as problems like "how to deal with sensor orientation discrepancy and dynamic change?", "how to expand a machine learning model to more sensors on the fly?" and "how to handle unlabled or sparsely labeled personal data?".

* `Sep. 2017 - Present` NHANES population study data processing

    > "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations." -- CDC.gov
    >
    > The whole dataset involves over 10000 US individuals each with 7-day's wrist accelerometer data sampled at 80 Hz.
    >
    > I have worked with students in cloud computing, in machine learning, Prof. Dinesh John in exercise science and Prof. Stephen Intille to come up with standardized protocol for data quality check and screening. 
    >
    > I have helped implementing various data processing algorithms including data format conversion, filtering detection and wear-nonwear detection. I have also successfully applied and validated the prior developed MIMS unit algorithm over around 700 individuals from NHANES dataset and will expand the validation to the entire dataset.

* `Apr. 2017 - Oct. 2017` Posture and daily activity recognition with multiple sensors: algorithm design and validation

    > The purpose of this project is to explore the impact of different sensor locations and find out the optimal single and dual sensor combinations for posture and daily activity recognition. To our knowledge, this paper is the first that systematically analyzed the impact of 7 single and 21 dual sensor locations for posture and activity recognition.
    > 
    > I developed this algorithm using sensor orientation specific features which significantly increased the performance. The algorithm achieves superior performance compared with prior publications.
    >
    > The algorithm is validated through the SPADES dataset (with 53 participants, each with 3 hour data containing 17 activites, total size around 3GB).
    > 
    > A journal publication related to this project is currently under review.

* `Sep. 2016 - Present` "Log My Life" research study (Android App developement)

    > This is a 2-year data collection project aiming to collect ecological momentary assessment (EMA) survey data and geological data using Android app throughout 7 days to analyze the correlation or impact of support housing to homeless teenagers about their sexual, drug and alcohol behaviors. It is a collaboration project with a public health team from USC.
    >
    > The study aims to deploy over 200? participants. Currently the app developement and test stage have finished.
    >  
    > I have been working on developing and maintaining the data collection app built with Android. The app uses firebase as data collection backend. The app supports 24/7 hour location sensing, dual EMA survey and daily log scheduling and remote configuring of surveys. The app also supports conditioning and looping routing logic which was unavailable in general EMA survey frameworks (e.g. Apple's ResearchKit and Google's StudyKit).

* `Sep. 2015 - Nov. 2017` MIMS unit algorithm design and validation

    > This project aims to develop a new signal processing algorithm called "MIMS" (aka. "Monitor independent movement summary") to summarize raw accelerometer data into epochs that can work across different devices. Such summaries can be used to measure the intensity, energy expenditure and Metabolic rate for physical activities. None of other similar summary agorithms can have consistent results across different devices.
    >
    > I developed the entire signal processing pipeline for this algorithm. The core idea is to restore raw accelerometer signal from low dynamic range devices using local spline regression and to apply a consistent interpolation and filtering strategy to harmonize the specification differences across devices.
    >
    > The validation experiment with shaker, treadmill and activity data has show MIMS algorithm has the lowest coefficient of variety over the other two most used algorithms: "Biobank ENMO" and "Actigraph's activity count".
    >
    > A journal paper of this algorithm has been submitted and currently under review.
    >
    > An open sourced R package has been released for this algorithm.

* `Jan. 2015 - Aug. 2016` "SPADES" mobile sensing research study (Android App developement)

    > Working on developing real-time physical activity measurement system on latest Android platforms (smart phone and smart watch). Finished development and deployed to 50 participants for long term (3 months) data collection. More than 50 bug fixes and more than 20 feature implementations during deployment. Current system worked reliably aiming to collect high quality long term real world dataset: collecting high sampling rate (50Hz) raw sensor data 24 hours without stopping for three months.
