## Bio
Qu Tang is a fourth year Ph.D student in Computer Engineering at Northeastern University (NU), Boston. He is now working as a research assistant with Professor [Stephen Intille](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/intille/) in [__Mobile Health Research Group__](http://mhealth.ccs.neu.edu/) at NU. His primary research interest is __mobile computing__ and __physical activity recognition__, especially in __recognition algorithm design__ and __physical activity data mining__. He is enthusiastic in applying engineering and computer science technologies to measure, monitor and improve personal health. Qu Tang got his M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at Northeastern in 2013 and his B.E. degree in Opto.-Electronics at University of Eletronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2010.

## Research
* `Jan. 2013-Present` __Research Assistant__ _Mobile Health Research Group @ Northeastern University, Boston, US_
    + __Physical activity recognition__: published 2 top tier conference papers (see above), analyzed at least 10G real world dataset in previous projects (mainly accelerometer data), which have been made open and publically accessible: smoking dataset and autism stereotypical motion dataset. Used time series (ARMA model), signal processing (spectrum analysis), statistics (correlation and regression analysis) and machine learning (WEKA and Scikit-learning, Random Forest, SVM and decision tree) in R, Java and Python. Collaborated with researchers from medical and health science background.
    + __Physical activity measurement__: Working on developing real-time physical activity measurement system on latest Android platforms (smart phone and smart watch). Finished development and deployed to 50 participants for long term (3 months) data collection. More than 50 bug fixes and more than 20 feature implementations during deployment. Current system worked reliably aiming to collect high quality long term real world dataset: collecting high sampling rate (50Hz) raw sensor data 24 hours without stopping for three months.
    + __API and visualization system development__: developed an online 3D data visualization system for consumption transaction data with R and Shiny; developed a real-time visualization system on PC (connect through Bluetooth) for accelerometer sensor (WOCKETS) with Java. Developing a Java and R library for the open mhealth data standard: mhealth format. Tools or library are used in the lab and some are used by our research collaborators with health background.

## Work, internship and independent projects
* __App development__ _Independent developer_
    + __Tower Airdrop__ is a 2D exergame in Android to promote kid's physical activity. It used Box2D as physical engine, and used internal sensors to detect activity intensity and tilting. See source code. This app is experimental and has stopped further development.
* `Dec. 2011-Aug. 2012` __Cooperative Education (COOP) Student__ _Vision Rehabilitation Laboratory @ Schepens Eye Research Institute, Boston, US_
    + __Research tools development__: extended a prism glasses training program in VB and C# by adding new GUIs, User feedback functionality and multimedia support. Fixed a critical bug caused by a false coordinate transformation between different screens that affects at least 10 training sessions. Wrote a hardware driver for joystick controller with Win32 API, as part of an eye tracking system in C/C++ for a collision measurement 3D virtual reality program, which is based on WTK(in C). Released two major versions for each programs and fixed tens of bugs in 8 months.
    + __Data visualization and analysis__: extended a visualization program in MATLAB to support new type of dataset. Helped design a mathematical model to measure the percentage of blocked object by scotoma field when driving, and designed the visualization scheme for it. The model helped to reveal important research conclusion that the percentage of blocked object correlated highly with the response rate of object detection by a subject.
    + Collaborated with researchers from opthalmology, psychology, engineering and physics.

## Other experiences
* `Sept. 2014 - Present` __Linux System Administrator__ _Mobile Health Research Group @ Northeastern University, Boston, US_
    + Wrote the lab's first system administration guidance (58 pages), designed workflows for system debugging, security managment, VM management and user authorization.
    + Created, configured 8 Virtual Machines running with QEMU and LVM, VMs are used for hosting wordpress websites or research projects for receiving and processing data from mobile phones.
    + Mail, SSH, Apache and Tomcat service management. Resolved 1 DDoS vulnerability of wordpress and several ubuntu system bugs which had led to slow connection, connection time dropped down by about 80%.
* `Sept. 2014-Dec. 2014` __Ph.D Seminar Coordinator__ _Personal Health Informatics Ph.D Program @ Northeastern University, Boston, US_
    + Organized weekly Ph.D seminar (7-8 times per semester) for PHI Ph.D program of Northeastern University. Average attendance is 10-20 people. PHI seminar series.
    + Selected, invited and coordinated with all the speakers (mainly faculties and researchers from both inside and outside campus), and advertised the events throughout the campus.
    + Acted as the host of all seminars.
